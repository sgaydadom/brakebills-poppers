Hello! My name is Sarah and I'm creating this website as a final project for one
of my grad school classes.
This is a sort of fan site for different characters from the Magicians TV show.
Since I started off this class practicing coding based on Margo and Elliot,
I figured I could just expand on everything and bring in whole separate pages
for my favorite characters.
