        <p>Elliot Waugh is a brilliant, chaotic, telekinetic, self-confident, dandy. Despite his seemingly polished and perfect demeanor, hidden beneath his satin vests and snarky humor Elliot is hiding an immense amount of pain. Having grown up in an atmosphere that stomped out anything different, abused and discarded the weak, Elliot made it his mission in life to build himself into a completely different person than he was before Brakebills. While aloof in general, Elliot does have an incredibly close and mildly co-dependent relationship with his platonic soulmate, Margo. Margo is the only person who knows all of Elliot's secrets and history, and has helped and supported him in his attempts to remake himself into his ideal image. While generous with his physical affection and humor, Elliot tends to be rather aloof or unreachable to the majority of students. As Q's designated guide to the Brakebills Entrance Exam, Elliot was the first magician to meet Q and impart his sarcastic humor onto the vulnerable and confused new student. Suprisingly loyal despite his seemingly careless veneer, Elliot adopts Q into the fold of his and Margo's world, allowing the other friends and allies to revolve around them like socially awkward and sometimes violent moons. Throughout the series we see Elliot grow as a person, develop more empathy and learn how to handle responsibilities on a truly ridiculous scale.</p>

            <blockquote>"Whatever happens next, I just want to thank you for giving us a moment where we can speak with no bullshit, and just say "I love you Margo"".</blockquote>
            <p>Margo and Elliot are best friends, co-rulers of Fillory (formerly), snarky party animals, and platonic soulmates. While Q and Elliot have a fascinating friendship and relationship develop throughout the series, the audience is always aware of how intrinsically linked these two are. Mildly co-dependent, Elliot and Margo revel in each other's company, and often hold themselves above and/or separate from the rest of the crowd, be it in the Physical Kids' Cottage where they are reigning Party Royalty, or as actual royalty when ruling Fillory. When Elliot goes into a depressive spiral after being forced to kill his boyfriend Mike,(who was the Beast/Martin Chatwin trying to collect information on the group) Margo is there to pick up the pieces. For all his disdain and condescension toward others, Margo (or Bambi as Elliot affectionately calls her) is the only one allowed to see him in all his vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>Margo is also the only one who knows the full truth about Elliot's past before he came to Brakebills. While Elliot tells Q about how he discovered he was telekinetic, no one else knows about the scared, abused, queer magician from Indiana. Brakebills students view him as cold but talented, gifted but untatainable. Only Margo is truly aware of how much effort Elliot had to put in to get to where he is, and who he is. In return, Elliot is the only one who knows all of Margo's past, the only one who she allows herself to be soft for (though she does have softer moments with Q and even Alice at one point).</p>

          <h2>Elliot and Quentin</h2>
            <blockquote><em>"If I ever get out of here Q, know that when I'm braver it's because I learned it from you."</em></blockquote>
            <p>The friendship between Elliot and Quentin is incredibly close. Elliot was designated Q's guide when he first came to Brakebills. At that point, Elliot only saw him as a cute distraction, one of his first year boys that he could play with and discard. When asked by Margo about his interest in Q, Elliot says "he's a highstrung supernerd, we love those". As the show goes on, Elliot and Q become proper friends, Elliot even had his golem "die" for Q when threatened. When Elliot has to kill Mike (a.k.a Martin Chatwin/The Beast) Q and Margo are both there to help him through it. While Elliot chooses a path of self-medication to the point of imobility, this eventually fades as he realizes he needs his wits to survive in Fillory, as well as the fact that Margo and Q are properly worried about him.</p>

            <p>The Mosaic Quest is a turning point in Q and Elliot's relationship. Spending 50 years stuck in a little cottage in Fillory, no magic and none of their other friends, Elliot and Q are forced to interact in ways that they would have previously tried to avoid. The quest tasks them with solving the Mosaic; the solution is supposed to be reflective of "the beauty of all life", which is of course, appropriately vague for a magical quest. Romance stirs, and on their first year anniversary of their time in the mosaic, Q kisses Elliot, who reciprocates. Elliot tells Q that they should "save all the over-thinking for the puzzle". Eventually they meet Arielle, a peach seller, and Quentin ends up marrying her, while still living with Elliot. Elliot and Q raise Q and Arielle's son, Teddy (Theodore Rupert Coldwater-Waugh) after Arielle dies. The two live full, happy lives as their son grows up. Elliot eventually dies of old age (or liver cancer, depending on what headcannon you subscribe to), and Q puts a final piece in the Mosaic. It is revealed that the "beauty of all life" is found through living it. Which is deep but also heart-breaking.</p>
