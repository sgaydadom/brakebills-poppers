        <p>When we first meet Q, he's a self described "depressed supernerd", introverted and lost in a world that he has never quite been able to interact with. He is more at home in the fictional world of Fillory-a combination of Narnia and Harry Potter-than going to bars or parties and spending time with people his age. With his childhood friend (and previous crush) Julia as his only real connection with the world, Q skates around the edges of society, desperately trying to find meaning, and the answers to his own mind.</p>

        <p>Cue Magic. Following a seemingly magic card through the alleys of New York, Q stumbles upon the campus of Brakebills University, a graduate school for people with latent magical abilities. Elated that all his dreams seem to have come true, that the fictional worlds and talents that he'd thought inaccessible, are suddenly within his reach, Q sets out to learn magic, and hopefully figure out why the supposedly fictional character of Jane Chatwin-a main character in the Fillory series-keeps appearing and telling him to venture off the garden path. Throughout the show, Q makes friends in the form of Alice Quinn-legacy student with a secret motivation to her Brakebills acceptance, Elliot Waugh, senior and "Party King" of campus and leader of the Physical Kids cottage; Margo Hanson, Elliot's best friend and an ambitious woman who knows her own self-worth; and the recurrence of Julia. He makes allies in the form of Hedgewitch Kady Orloff-Diaz, Psychic and Traveler (teleporter) Penny Adiyodi, and friendly Nature student and drug dealer extrodinaire, Josh Hoberman.</p>
