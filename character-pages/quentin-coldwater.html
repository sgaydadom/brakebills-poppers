      <blockquote><em>"My friend Julia said that I couldn't run away hard enough. She's right. I run and I find secret doors - whether I'm alone or in a group, it doesn't matter. Like I'm here. I'm in this amazing place. I have literal magic in my life and I'm still running. I'm still this person that I fucking hate."</em></blockquote>

        <p>When we first meet Q, he's a self described "depressed supernerd", introverted and lost in a world that he has never quite been able to interact with. He is more at home in the fictional world of Fillory-a combination of Narnia and Harry Potter-than going to bars or parties and spending time with people his age. With his childhood friend (and previous crush) Julia as his only real connection with the world, Q skates around the edges of society, desperately trying to find meaning, and the answers to his own mind.</p>

        <p>Cue Magic. Following a seemingly magic card through the alleys of New York, Q stumbles upon the campus of Brakebills University, a graduate school for people with latent magical abilities. Elated that all his dreams seem to have come true, that the fictional worlds and talents that he'd thought inaccessible, are suddenly within his reach, Q sets out to learn magic, and hopefully figure out why the supposedly fictional character of Jane Chatwin-a main character in the Fillory series-keeps appearing and telling him to venture off the garden path. Throughout the show, Q makes friends in the form of Alice Quinn,legacy student with a secret motivation to her Brakebills acceptance; Elliot Waugh, senior and "Party King" of campus and leader of the Physical Kids cottage; Margo Hanson, Elliot's best friend and an ambitious woman who knows her own self-worth; and the recurrence of Julia. He makes allies in the form of Hedgewitch Kady Orloff-Diaz, Psychic and Traveler (teleporter) Penny Adiyodi, and friendly Nature student and drug dealer extrodinaire, Josh Hoberman.</p>

        <blockquote><em>"A magician is strong because he hurts more than others. His wound is his strength. Most people carry that pain around inside them their whole lives, until they kill the pain by other means, or until it kills them. But you, my friends, you found another way: a way to use the pain. To burn it as fuel, for light and warmth. You have learned to break the world that has tried to break you."
        -Lev Grossman, The Magicians</em></blockquote>

        <p>Elliot and Margo take Q under their wing. While originally patronizing and aloof to Quentin and his introverted quirks, the two of them eventually gain respect for Q as a Magician and a friend. Despite an adventurous drunked three-some that ends Q's burgeoning relationship with Alice, the affection between Quentin, Elliot, and Margo is clear.</p>

        <p>An interesting part of Quentin's character is the way his knowledge of the "fictional" land from <em>Fillory and Further</em> is percieved as nerdy until Fillory is proven to a)a real place b)the home of the magical Beast tormenting Q and his friends c)confusing, dangerous and serverly lacking in taco supplies.
        Throughout the show, Quentin's love of Fillory perseveres, even when the twin gods (Ember and Umber) grow bored of the land they created, even when the Beast (a dark twisted version of Martin Chatwin-one of the children who originally found Fillory) spends 39 time loops trying to destroy Q and his friends. To Quentin, Fillory meant something. It saved his life when he was suicidal, promising the hope that in a place like Fillory, Quentin and people like him could be happy. Even when politics, infighting, curses, and tragedies plagued him, wrapped up in Fillorian and normal guises alike, Quentin still held onto hope that Fillory could be more than it was. </p>
