          <p>The "Magicians" by Lev Grossman has a startling amount of characters, all with depth and interests that are not dependent on each other. The ones I like to focus on the most, are Quentin "Q" Coldwater (The main protagonist), Margo "Bambi" Hanson, and Elliot Waugh.</p>

          <blockquote><em>"My friend Julia said that I couldn't run away hard enough. She's right. I run and I find secret doors - whether I'm alone or in a group, it doesn't matter. Like I'm here. I'm in this amazing place. I have literal magic in my life and I'm still running. I'm still this person that I fucking hate."</em></blockquote>

          <p></p>Quentin is a depressed person. This is instrinsic to understanding his character. The reason he was always so obsessed with the fictional land of Fillory (and others like it) was because he desperately relied on the promise that Fillory made. The promise that Quentin, and people like him could be happy if they just found the right place. A major part of Q's journey, is discovering that nothing can fix his depression: not magic, not Fillory, not even having friends in the mad world it became. This is further emphasized throughout the show with the quote from Dean Fogg: "Magic doesn't come from talent. It comes from pain". Still, regardless of his circumstances, Q is a loyal, devoted friend. He's okay being the "sidekick", despite his desire for more. He goes to the ends of the earth to resurrect Alice when she dies in a timeline, and then again when she becomes a Niffin after fighting the Beast. Quentin is unique in that his passion, while often dismissed by others in the show; be it Julia who tells him he needs to grow up, to Alice who tells him that he needs to cheer up and that he's lettting himself be miserable even in Fillory.</p>

          <p>In the end, Q sacrifices himself when throwing the Monster that possessed Eliot, into the Seam. Doing magic in the Mirror World is instant-death, and Q was no exception. He left behind a grieving group of friends and a heart-broken Eliot, who with Q and Margo's effort had become de-posessed.</p>
