        <p>Margo Hanson is brilliant, beautiful, and dangerous. She could have quite easily been portrayed as simply the mean girl, but due to the quality of the character, script, and acting choices made by Summer Bishil (Margo) and Hale Appleman(Elliot) she became a fan favorite. A gifted magician, Margo is a porcupine of an individual. With the exception of her best friend and platonic soulmate, Elliot, Margo is rarely soft. Eventually her vague amusement at Quentin fades to reluctant respect and affection. She supports him, while also not shying away from telling him the hard truths that he may want to deny. For example, she talks with him when he returns from Dean Fogg after learning how magic is truly powered. They discuss how life is unfair and that they wish magic was powered through positive emotions such as love or friendship.</p>


        <h2>Margo and Elliot</h2>

        <blockquote><em>"When we're the least snobby people in a room, there's something wrong with the room."</em></blockquote>

        <p>The relationship between Elliot and Margo is an incredibly close one. Secrets partners in the Trials, they know each other's deepest darkest secrets, and would never even consider using that as amunition against each other. Margo even tells Elliot one day "I think you're the only person I can actually stand". Incredibly loyal though their friendship is, its not without it's challenges. The first time we see a rift appear between Elliot and Margo is when Elliot stops his promiscous ways to become in a committed relationship with Mike McCormac (later revealed to be Martin Chatwin/The Beast). Margo helps pick up the pieces and saves Elliot's life when he is so drunk post-Mike murder that he almost gets eaten alive. The biggest fight they ever have is when Elliot runs for High King of Fillory and decides he doesn't think Margo should be on the ticket with him. Outraged and hurt, Margo sees this as her friend not believing in her. After all that, Margo wins the role of High King through write-in vote. Elliot wastes no time in declaring his fielty to her, and telling her (with zero resentment) that she will be an amazing king.</p>

        <p>When Elliot gets possessed by the Monster at Blackspire, Margo goes so far as to cede her crown to Fen, so that she can leave Fillory and find a way to save Elliot. She travels the Wandering Desert, and emerges victorious winning the twin de-possession axes "Sorrow and Sorrow". Using these axes she gores Elliot and rids him of the Monster possessing him.</p>

        <h2>Margo and Quentin</h2>

        <blockquote><em>"You're [Q] honest about what you love. And underneath it all, that's kind of inspiring."</em></blockquote>

        <p>Margo does not start off as intrigued by Q as Elliot. She enjoys teasing Quentin and being sometimes cruelly hilarious, though Quentin gets to the point where he lets it roll off him and/or can be snarky back. Throughout the series Margo goes from begrudging ally to having Q be one of her closest friends. They talk about the Fillory books, and Margo reveals that she read them all and can keep up with Q's analyses. She also sees his value in that he can tell them whatever they need about Fillory due to his vast knowledge of it. When Q offers to stay in Blackspire Castle as a replacement for the original Monster-minder, Elliot panics and Margo immediately defies Q's desires. She hands Elliot the God-killing gun, hoping that between her and Elliot, Q the Monster will die and Q will be saved from having to spend an eternity in Blackspire, alone with a psychotic murder-child. This plan back-fires when the gun doesn't kill the Monster, only it's original host, forcing it to relocate, where it eventually ends up in Elliot's body.</p>

        <p>During her quest to save Elliot, she sees Q as her one staunch ally, both of them refusing to believe that Elliot is dead, and that all that is left is the Monster possessing him. She trusts Q to watch the Monster and make sure it doesn't destroy Elliot's body. This is tantamount to Margo entrusting Q with her life, as Elliot is the most important person in her life. After she de-possesses Elliot with her axes, Q goes to the Seam, where he ends up sacrificing himself to get rid of the Monster forever. While eternally grateful to have Elliot back, Margo mourns Q, and regrets that she wasn't there to support him as well as she'd have liked. In the bonfire-wake they have for Q, where Julia burns a deck of cards Quentin used to use, Margo chooses to burn Q's crown from Fillory, seeing that as not only a significant moment for Q, but also for her. She also repeatedly checks in with Elliot to see how he's doing, knowing that Q wasn't just important to her, but that Elliot and Q had a complex and beautiful relationship. She mourns for Q, but has to make herself move forward, but acknowledges Elliot's need to go with Alice up the Mountain of Ghosts. She knows Elliot needs to say goodbye in the only way he has left.</p>
