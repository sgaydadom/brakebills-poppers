        <p>Julia is one of Quentin's childhood friends. Originally dating his other friend James (priory to her discovery of magic) Julia was on track to attend Princeton. When she fails her Brakebills entrance exam, Julia's memory is wiped. Unfortunately, she remembers and finds her way to a hedgewitch coven run by Marina Andriesky. Desperate for any knowledge of the magic world, Julia works with Kady to follow Marina's instructions, which leads to her accidenal imprisonment of Quentin in a world of his own nightmares (The Scarlotti Web). This betrayal poisons Elliot and Margo towards her, though that ice eventually melts. Julia often wishes Q could see himself the way she does, and reach all the potential she sees sitting within him. This however leads to her sometimes not quite understanding the struggles he faces with his mental health.</p>

        <p>After being assaulted by demi-god Reynard the Fox, the goddess Persephone (Reynard's mother) takes Reynard's magic and gifts it to Julia. When returning to Fillory to plant trees as penance for her murder of the talking trees while she was without her Shade, the people of Fillory dub her "Our Lady of the Tree". In order to bring back and protect magic, Julia sacrifices her powers to create new Magic Keys. Distraught without her goddhood, Julia spirals for awhile, before attempting to bring back her magic. Julia is a talented magician, studying Meta-Composition. Sadly, magic isn't born from talent. It's born through pain. And only with the death of her best and oldest friend (Quentin) does her magic reappear.</p>
