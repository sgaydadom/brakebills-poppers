        <p>A legacy student, Alice grew up knowledgable of the world of magic. Unlike Q, who stumbles through life and into his graduate opportunity at Brakebills, Alice was born into a family of powerful and famous magicians.
          Her brother Charlie was a former student at Brakebills, and went missing-presumed dead. Determined to uncover the truth of how her beloved brother passed, Alice cares little about the talents of those around her, choosing to focus
          soley on her daunting task.

          Quiet, studious, and with a genius intellect, Alice tends to keep to herself and finds relying on others to be challenging, and often useless. This slowly changes when she meets Quentin who despite being a fairly mediocre magician,
          is kind, loyal, and genuinely wants to help her find answers. Throughout the show, Alice and Quentin have an on-off romantic relationship that often seems to be more drama than its worth to outside perspectives. This being said,
          Alice and Q do care about each other greatly. Quentin going as far as possible to save her life and return her from Niffin form; Alice trying to resurrect Q from his demise in the Mirror Realm.</p>

        <p>Throughout the show, Alice becomes less guarded around the group, though wary in the beiginning in regards to Margo's attempts to befriend her. At the end of the Key Quest, Alice-believing that magic is always big and dangerous, and
          that humans don't deserve it, tries to destroy magic, betraying the entire group as a result. Though horrible, this occurence gets overshadowed by the all-powerful Monster that even the gods fear, accidentally released by Elliot Waugh.</p>
