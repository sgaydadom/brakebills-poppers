        <p>A group of students from different walks of life, and with different hidden capabilities, are given the chance to sit for entrance exams at Brakebills University. Brakebills is a university that trains magicians. Hidden from the eyes of non-magic folk, Brakebills exists in up-state New York, and is overseen by the alocholic master magician, Dean Henry Fogg. Fogg reveals that magic comes from pain, and if this is the case, it is no surprise that the students focused on are such powerful magicians indeed. Tragedy is common among magicians, and just because one is powerful doesn't mean that there isn't something out there that is stronger. Will these students be able to overcome the challenges (magical and mundane) that plague them, and stay safe at the same time?</p>

        <p>The main characters this show focuses on are mostly students of the Physical Discipline. Quentin, a high-strung supernerd with an obsession revolving around the fantasy land of Fillory has the Discipline (talent) called "Repair of Small Objects".  Alice Quinn, legacy student and on-off girlfriend of Q, practices Phosphoromancy (control of light). Elliot Waugh, is a 3rd year, one of the leaders of the Physical Kids' Cottage, and a powerful telekinetic. Co-leading the Cottage in parties and just about everything else, is Margo Hanson. Tough, powerful, brilliant, and take-charge, Margo puts up with nothing and though her Physical Discipline is never specified, some fans speculate it has to do with Cold Magic. Kady Orloff-Diaz, a hedgewitch turned reluctant ally, specializes in Battle Magic-something that Brakebills frowns upon due to the often extreme aftermath of any casting errors.</p>

        <p> Q's childhood friend Julia is not in the Physical Discipline, instead (after much ado) choosing to become a Knowledge Student with a focus in Meta-Composition.Like Julia, Penny Adiyodi is not a member of the Physical Kids' Cottage, though he spends a lot of time there because of his friends and girlfriend (Kady Orloff-Diaz) living there. Penny is Psychic Magic student, with a specific Discipline of Travelling (teleportation) and Astral-Projection.</p>
